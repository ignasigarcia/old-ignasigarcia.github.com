Hi, I am Ignasi.

I work as a Lead Developer at IPC Media, a publishing company from London. I work for sites like <a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com">Trusted Reviews</a> and <a href="http://www.decanter.com">Decanter</a>. Before that I worked on <a href="http://www.segundamano.es">Segundamano.es</a>, the classified's leader in Spain, where I am from.

I enjoy building things, and I am currently interested in creating games in HTML5 and backend applications in GO, so you will see more of this stuff in this blog. I have extensive experience in PHP and Javascript.
